# NewTempo
For testing purposrs, please build the project in a real device. 
This app contains features that the simulator does not support like initiating a phone call and sending an email, etc., 
so if you test these features the simulator would crash, but they works fine in real devices.

When building it into real devices, please open the .xcworkspace file rather than the .xcodeproject file in the ios folder, 
and use that file to build.

Have Fun!
